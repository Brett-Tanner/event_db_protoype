# Things to do better
## Important
- Testing
- Optimisation of AR queries to reduce cost of running the server
- Validations, server side for security and client-side/controller for UX
    - Other UX changes with JS/Stimulus

## Nice to have
- Better use of partials
- Better/more associations so queries don't take a whole line
