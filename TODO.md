# Future Notes

- I can probably autogenerate the correct number of days for an event based on the start and end dates, then redirect to a form where they set up those days after the event is successfully created
    - But there are holidays and weekends, so maybe a calendar based date picker would be better
- [Better way to do views for different roles in the future](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39970314/how-do-i-create-multiple-views-for-different-users-by-role)
- Have the new event button/link be a mini form with a date picker that'll submit the start/end date as params to event#new, allowing the correct number of event day fields to be present on the same page you create the event on
